# Game Of Life

## Description
> This game is a cellular automaton invented by the English mathematician John Conway in 1970. In this game, you create an initial state and then watch as it evolves. Each cell can be either “alive” (filled) or “dead” (empty). Generations are replaced synchronously according to simple rules:
> - An empty (dead) cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
> - A live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
> - In all other cases, a live cell dies from loneliness or overcrowding.
>
> The game of “Life” does not have players, and you cannot influence its course. Instead, you can create different initial states and observe how they develop. This can be very engaging and can help you better understand how cellular automata work.
